    <p> The Golden State Warriors of 2015 - 2016 are arguably the greatest team of all time. The only team comparable to them are the 1995 - 1996 Bulls. While the two teams are comparable in most of their stats, the Warriors have an edge in every category that make them statistically the better team. The way the efficiency was derived was by taking each category and dividing it by the minutes played to show how each team accumlated stats in the short amount of time played. The reason this is important because the more stats the team can produce in the amount of time they played, the better the team.
